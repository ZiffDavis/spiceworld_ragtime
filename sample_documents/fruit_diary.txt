11.01.2024 - I had that dream again. The one where the list of available fruits became longer by one fruit. I think it was called "cantalope" but that can't be right, because that's the name of a deer.

11.03.2024 - The dream came back. This time during the day. I fell asleep during a meeting with my boss. I woke up quickly with a yelp and howled something that sounded like "pair" but I was talking about a fruit! It makes no sense.

11.06.2024 - Someone on the subway was talking with someone else on the subway today about something they referred to as "grapes" -- I quickly shut my ears, afraid for my fruit innocence.
